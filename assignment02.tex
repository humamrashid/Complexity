    2. Let $X$ be a problem that is in the class $\mathcal{NP}$. For each of the following
    statements, write if it is ``True,'' ``False,'' or ``We don't know.'' Justify your answers.\\
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Solutions to $X$ can be verified with a polynomial-time algorithm.
        \item There is no polynomial-time algorithm for $X$.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for $X$, then $\mathcal{P} =
            \mathcal{NP}$.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for $X$, then there must exist a
            polynomial-time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem, then
