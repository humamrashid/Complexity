    2. Let \emph{X} be a problem that is in the class $\mathcal{NP}$. For each of the following
    statements, write if it is ``True,'' ``False,'' or ``We don't know.'' Justify your answers.\\
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Solutions to \emph{X} can be verified with a polynomial-time algorithm.
        \item There is no polynomial-time algorithm for \emph{X}.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for \emph{X}, then $\mathcal{P} =
            \mathcal{NP}$.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for \emph{X}, then there must exist a
            polynomial-time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem, then
