    % Problem 1.

    1. For each of the following statements, write if it is ``True,'' ``False,'' or ``We don't
    know.'' Justify your answers.\\
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item A problem $Q$ can be in $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{NP}$.\\
            \medskip
            \textbf{True}. According to the definitions given in \cite{modernapp}, $\mathcal{P} =
            \bigcup_{c \geq 1}$DTIME$(n^c)$, the class of languages decidable in polynomial time by
            a \emph{deterministic} Turing machine and $\mathcal{NP} = \bigcup_{c \in
            \mathbb{N}}$NTIME$(n^c)$, the class of languages decidable in polynomial time by a
            \emph{nondeterministic} Turing machine. Further, it is shown that $\mathcal{P} \subseteq
            \mathcal{NP}$. Therefore, if $Q \in \mathcal{P}$, then $Q \in \mathcal{NP}$. This also
            follows from the intuitive notion that $\mathcal{P}$ is the class of problems with
            ``efficiently computable solutions'' and $\mathcal{NP}$ is the class of problems with
            ``efficiently verifiable solutions'', i.e., any solutions that are efficiently solvable
            must necessarily also be efficiently verifiable. The reverse set membership question,
            whether $\mathcal{NP} \subseteq \mathcal{P}$, is not currently known to be true or
            false.
        \item A problem $Q$ can be in $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete.\\
            \medskip
            \textbf{We don't know}. According to the definitions given in \cite{modernapp}, a
            language $L'$ is $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete if $L'$ is $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard and $L' \in
            \mathcal{NP}$, and that a language $L'$ is $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard if $L$ is polynomial-time
            Karp reducible to $L'$ for all $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. It has not been shown for any $L$
            that $L \in \mathcal{P}$ and $L$ is $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard. If this were to be shown, it
            would give us an affirmitive answer to the question of whether $\mathcal{P} =
            \mathcal{NP}$ (theorem 2.8 in \cite{modernapp}).
        \item A problem $Q$ can be in $\mathcal{NP}$ and $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete.\\
            \medskip
            \textbf{True}. This is directly from the definition of $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete.
    \end{enumerate}

    % Problem 2.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    2. Let $X$ be a problem that is in the class $\mathcal{NP}$. For each of the following
    statements, write if it is ``True,'' ``False,'' or ``We don't know.'' Justify your answers.\\
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Solutions to $X$ can be verified with a polynomial-time algorithm.\\
            \medskip
            \textbf{True}. This is directly from the definition of $\mathcal{NP}$.
        \item There is no polynomial-time algorithm for $X$.\\
            \medskip
            \textbf{We don't know}.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for $X$, then $\mathcal{P} =
            \mathcal{NP}$.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for $X$, then there must exist a
            polynomial-time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
        \item If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem, then
            there must exist a polynomial-time algorithm for $X$.
