    % Problem 1 on proof by induction.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    1. Solve the summation.
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=1}^{n} 4i
    \end{align*}
    \textit{Solution}:
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=1}^{n} 4i &= 4 \sum_{i=1}^{n} i\\
                          &= 4 (\frac{n (n + 1)}{2})\;\text{by sum of first $n$ natural numbers}\\
                          &= 2n(n + 1)
    \end{align*}

    % Problem 2 on recurrence equations.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    2. Solve the following recurrence and prove the solution correct with induction:
    \begin{align*}
        T(1) &= 0\\
        T(n) &= n + T(\frac{n}{2})
    \end{align*}
    \textit{Solution}: $T(n) = n lg(n)$, by guessing.
    \medskip
    \begin{proof}
        For $k < n$, we have:\\
        \begin{align*}
            T(k) &= k lg(k)\\
            T(n) &= n + 2 T(\frac{n}{2})\\
            T(n) &= n + 2 (\frac{n}{2} lg(n) - \frac{n}{2})\\
            T(n) &= n + (n lg(n) - n)\\
            T(n) &= n lg(n)
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
